1. Update OPENAI_API_KEY:
   On Directory "gpt-open-api-system\src", open "api_layer.rs" and search for this line of code "let api_key: String = String::from("Bearer OPENAI_API_KEY") ". Replace OPENAI_API_KEY with your key to proceed with testing.

2. Create `.env` file:

   ```

3. Run the server:

   ```

4. Using a different terminal send an HTTP POST requests to the running server:

   Directory "gpt-open-api-system\apis" contains below listed api file:
